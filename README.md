## Motivation and Action

Maybe someday, your favorite AI company will force you to make your stable diffusion models private. It's time to copy and paste them to other cloud providers to ensure they can't be taken down. This repo will begin with 105 models from the [stable-diffusion-webui-colab](https://github.com/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab) project and will provide a simple JSON file for the data inside. It will continue to grow.

## What is the AI Creator Archive 

An AI Creator Archive is a repository of information about the individuals and teams who create and develop artificial intelligence models. 
The archive can include information such as the creators' notable contributions to the field of AI.
It also include information about the AI models they have developed. 
The purpose of an AI Creator Archive is to provide transparency and recognition for the creators of AI models. 
It is also useful for people who are interested in learning about the history and development of AI and the people behind it.

## Contributing to the AI Creator Archive
Just open an issue with your `username`, `model name`, `model version`, `model token(s)`, `model direct link` or `Google Drive link`, `4 images with PNG info`, and if you want, an `info.txt` <br> And if you would like to contribute to the development of the webiste you could contribute to the [AICA](https://github.com/camenduru/aica) repository, after getting in touch with us over [Discord](https://discord.gg/pQQ5mkKJkJ).

## Image Formats
Images should not contain any nudity. Remember how GitHub deleted the web UI without warning.

## Automation Design

All files and the Colab notebook will be created with the server, the Colab will be published on this link: https://github.com/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui-colab

#### links.txt format

```
Models should be PyTorch safetensors format if not please convert with this https://github.com/camenduru/converter-colab
Each line must contain one direct link to the model, not the model page. The magnet should contain only the model.
